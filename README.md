# **Energy Consumption Optimization Project**

## **Overview**
This project aims to tackle the challenges of high energy consumption inefficiencies by leveraging advanced AI techniques, including Local LLMs (Large Language Models) and anomaly detection algorithms like IsolationForest. The solution is designed to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and provide actionable insights to users while ensuring data privacy through secure, local processing.
